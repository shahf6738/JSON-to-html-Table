# JSON-to-html-Table

Creating html table dynamically using json object.

Assignment #2 for everlytics..

Developing Table using Javascript. The data for the table should come from a JSON file stored on the server.

The specific requirement here is to make sure the Table is built dynamically using JS (but not statically using HTML). If built that way the Table would get updated automatically (upon page refresh) when the data in the underlying JSON file changes.
